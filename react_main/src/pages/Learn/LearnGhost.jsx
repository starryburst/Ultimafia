            The objective of Ghost is to keep the secret word secret. The
            villagers begin the game knowing the word (chosen by the host),

            Each player takes a turn giving a clue related to the word to reveal
            themselves to other villagers without revealing the word to the
            ghosts. After each round of clues a person is voted out as the
            ghost. If they were in fact the ghost, they have a chance to guess
            the secret word to win. Alternatively, the ghosts may win if they
            gain a majority.
